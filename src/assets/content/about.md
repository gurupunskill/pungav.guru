#### Hi. Salut. வணக்கம்.
I decided to make a portfolio page for myself during the COVID-19 quarantine but now that I'm here, I am at a loss of words. After multiple attempts at describing myself, I've come to the conclusion that nothing I say about myself would ever feel right to me.

The gist is that I like computers and programming. I am a freelance software developer and I interned at Microsoft in the summer of 2019.  I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from NITK Surathkal and I am looking to pursue a career in research and development.
