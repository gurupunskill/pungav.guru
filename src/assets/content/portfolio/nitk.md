%no-margin%I did my major project under Prof. Basavaraj Talawar. We worked on designing solutions to memory allocation in heterogenous memory systems. We designed a library that would automatically allocate objects in such systems and provided a malloc-like API that would allow developers to easily build applications for heterogenous systems.
