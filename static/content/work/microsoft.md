I was tasked with building an end-to-end system to generate insights from Microsoft Office Telemetry data. The system involved multiple chained services that would perform distributed calculations and generate summaries from the data. Every service was written in **C#** and executed scripts on **Microsoft's Azure Data Lake**. The summarized data was then pushed to **Azure Data Explorer** and visualized using **PowerBI**.
